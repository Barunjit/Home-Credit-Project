# Home-Credit-Project - Introduction

This project is about accurately predicting the loan repayment abilities of customers (In this case they are people with insufficient or non- existent credit histories) to ensure that the clients capable of repayment are not rejected.

My client is Home Credit, an international consumer finance provider with operations in 19 countries. They focus on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history.

An optimum solution will ensure that home credit clients capable of repayment are not rejected and at the same time will also ensure minimum loss to home credit because of giving
loans to future defaulters.

I have gone through different processes/steps while doing this project. The steps are listed below.
