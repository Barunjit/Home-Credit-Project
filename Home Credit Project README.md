# Home-Credit-Project - Introduction

This project is about accurately predicting the loan repayment abilities of customers (In this
case they are people with insufficient or non- existent credit histories) to ensure that the
clients capable of repayment are not rejected.

My client is Home Credit, an international consumer finance provider with operations in 9
countries. They focus on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history.

An optimum solution will ensure that home credit clients capable of repayment are not
rejected and at the same time will also ensure minimum loss to home credit because of giving
loans to future defaulters.

I have gone through different processes/steps while doing this project. The steps are listed below.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis : Refer to the <b> Data Story </b> Folder to access the notebook and understand the process and insights.

2. Statistical Data Analysis : Refer to the ### Inferential Statistics ### Folder to access the notebook and understand the statistical analysis performed on the data.
